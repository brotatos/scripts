A simple script that creates a temporary file and proceeds to upload it, output the URL, and then remove it.

yt and clipyt

These two scripts work in conjunction to view videos off of youtube using mplayer and [youtube-viewer](https://github.com/trizen/youtube-viewer).

yt takes the current clipboard and outputs it to clipyt which execs youtube-viewer for it.
